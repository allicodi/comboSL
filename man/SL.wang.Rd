\usage{
SL.wang(
  Y,
  X,
  newX,
  family = gaussian(),
  obsWeights = rep(1, length(Y)),
  g = "log",
  m = length(Y),
  c = 0.2,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric outcome variable}

\item{X}{A \code{data.frame} of covariates constituting the training sample}

\item{newX}{A \code{data.frame} with the same column names and format as \code{X} constituting
the validation sample.}

\item{family}{Gaussian only}

\item{obsWeights}{Observation-level weights (not currently used)}

\item{g}{Transformation to apply to \code{Y} before quantile regression is used. Choices
are \code{"log"} or \code{"sqrt"}}

\item{m}{Number of quantiles to compute}

\item{c}{Constant used to determine truncation level for transforming quantiles to conditional
mean}

\item{b}{Constant used to determine truncation level for transforming quantiles to conditional
mean}

\item{...}{Other arguments (not currently used)}
}
\value{
\describe{
 \item{\code{pred}}{Predicted outcomes based on predictors in \code{newX}}
 \item{\code{fit}}{A list with named entries \code{object} (the fitted \code{rq} regression object),
                   \code{alpha} (the controlled level of trimming based), and \code{g_inv}
                   (the inverse function of the inputted \code{g})}
}
}
\description{
This function implements the estimator of Wang and Zhou (2010).
The estimator estimates the conditional mean costs by modeling the conditional quantiles of a transformed cost.
Using the equivariance property of quantiles to monotone transformations, the quantile estimators may be
transformed back to the conditional mean cost on the original scale.

# load cost data
